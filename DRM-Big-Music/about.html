        <p id="about-paragraph">Damon MacLeod is an aspiring singer-songwriter who has been making his way up and blessing lives with his music for 6 years now. He comes from a family of six where he is the oldest child. He was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and still devotedly practices his faith, partly through his music. Damon is currently a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho where he is studying Computer Information Technology. Before his time at school he served a full-time mission for the Church he attends from July 2019-June 2021, having served in the Philippines (where he learned the Tagalog language) and Colorado Springs. Damon is also an athlete, a hard-worker, and lover of learning and inspiring others.</p>
