      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[1.	Idea/Goal
        a.	Personal Music-Business Webpage. Make it easy for listeners to find information about me and my music all in one place.
        b.	(Those who fulfill a certain requirement will get a free something or deal)
        2.	Site Explanation (Purpose and Function)
        a.	I want my website to invite people to listen to my music, seek it out, and share it. I want it to not only show people where to find my music, but to tell the story behind each song and get to know me in a personal way through such to establish a personal connection with each listener.
        3.	USP (Unique Selling Proposition)
        a.	Websites make it easy to find a plethora of information in one place. My site will allow listeners to find pertinent information about the artist in a simple and efficient way and make it easier for others to find the same as well.  
        4.	Engage with a Question
        a.	For those of you who love music, have you ever wanted a personal connection with your favorite artists? To know the real-life stories behind their music?
        5.	Put it all Together
        a.	This site is the official site of DRM-Big-Music with a purpose and intent to connect listeners with the artist—in a more personal way—through the artist’s music and the stories behind them. In a world where a song is just a song, and an artist is just another artist, DRM-Big-Music has a goal to make music meaningful and relevant to all people and provide an easy way to find such content in a simple way, all in one place!
